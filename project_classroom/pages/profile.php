                <em>digital marketer based in Brooklyn</em>
                <p>My regular workday consists of carrying out digital marketing initiatives for a commercial real estate firm, but I have been elevating my graphic design skills by doing freelance projects for friends and family. References have resulted in an uptick in requests so I have created this space to showcase my work and take on new projects. Feel free to contact me using the form below!</p>
